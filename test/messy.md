#    Welcome to Markdown Mayhem 🎪

This file is intentionally chaotic.  It's valid Obsidian-flavored markdown, but formatted like a toddler who just discovered keyboards.   Your Prettier plugin will hopefully turn this hot mess into something beautiful! 

## Headers Gone Wild 🎢

Here are some headings with inconsistent spacing and random trailing spaces.    

###Sub-heading that forgot about personal space
#### Spaced    out     header   like    my    brain   

#####Missing space after hash because why not

ATX Header That Looks Confused
------

Random tagging spree: #project #todo #help-me #why-does-this-exist


###    Another header with commitment issues   




## Link Soup 🍜

Inline link party: [Obsidian homepage](https://obsidian.md "The best note app ever")

Reference-style shenanigans: see [Ref Link][ref-link] and again [ref-link] because repetition is fun.

Autolink madness: <https://example.com/test?a=1&b=2&chaos=true>

Bare URL just chilling: https://example.com/some/incredibly/long/path/that/goes/on/forever (should remain autolinked)

Wikilinks everywhere: [[Some Page]] and [[Another Page|Custom Drama]] and [[deeply/nested/chaos/page]].

Image wikilink surprise: ![[assets/screenshot 1.png]]

Inline wikilink invasion: [[ProjectXYZ]] and a mysterious block reference: [[#^abc123]]

Email links having a party: test@example.com and <another@example.com>

Footnote madness[^1] and another brain explosion[^long-note].

## List Anarchy 📝

- Unordered list pretending to be organized
  - nested 1 (living its best life)
    - nested 2 (going deeper)
-Item two (missing space like my motivation)
   - Deeply indented and confused
 - Wrong indentation because consistency is overrated
- Item with **bold** declarations and *italic* whispers

- [ ] todo with inconsistent spaces  
-[x]done-without-space-because-efficiency
- [ ] spaced task that's probably never getting done  
-[ ] Missing space in task land

1. Ordered list item 1 (the beginning)
2.Missing space because who needs breathing room
   3. Wrong number alignment living dangerously
 4. Another wrong indent joining the rebellion
1. Wrong numbering strikes again
10. Dramatic jump to ten because plot twists

## Code Chaos Central 💻

Indented code block having an identity crisis:

    function hello(){
      console.log("hi from the void");}

Fenced code block (language specified for the algorithm overlords):

```js
// messy JS that makes developers cry
const s = "string"    
function f(a,b){return a+b}  // no spaces, just vibes
```

```javascript
// More messy code block
function   messyFunction(  ){
  console.log(   "spaces everywhere like confetti"   );
    return    true;
}
```

Fenced code block with trailing spaces and existential dread:

```python  
def foo():
    return 'bar'  # the eternal question

```

```
Plain code block
  with weird indentation
    that defies explanation
      and logic
```

Inline code having identity issues: `x = 1`  and inline math showing off: $E=mc^2$ 

Crazy inline math: $\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}$

More math chaos:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## Table Disaster Zone 📊

| Column A |ColumnB|  Column C  |
|---|  :---:   |---:|
| 1 | two | three |
| four | five |six |
|   Long content that overstays its welcome   |Short|Mix of everything|
| Another | Chaotic | Row |

## Quote Soup and Blockquote Bedlam 🗣️

> A quote with a sneaky link [Link][ref-link] hiding inside

>"Smart quotes" and 'single smart quotes' having philosophical debates

> Blockquote level 1 contemplating existence
>> Nested blockquote going deeper into the rabbit hole
>>> Deeply nested quote approaching singularity

> Multi-line
> blockquote adventure
> with formatting **bold** statements and `code` snippets

Regular paragraph after quote, trying to be normal.

## Callout Blitz 🔮

> [!NOTE]
> This is a callout with a trailing space and a sneaky link: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)  
> Also a wikilink adventure: [[Home Page]] and a fancy alias [[Daily Notes|Daily Adventures]]

>[!WARNING]  
>Missing space in block because rules are suggestions

> [!TIP] Pro tip from your friendly neighborhood markdown
> 
> Multiple paragraphs of wisdom
> 
> - With nested lists of enlightenment
> - And even more chaotic content
> - Item with [random link](https://example.com) thrown in
## Emphasis Explosion 💥

**Bold text** screaming and __also bold__ whispering and ***bold italic*** having an identity crisis and ___also bold italic___ joining the party

*Italic text* leaning and _also italic_ slanting

~~Strikethrough~~ crossing things out and ==highlight== making things glow

## Media Madness 📸

## Special Characters and Unicode Party 🎉

Emoji invasion: 😀 😅 🤖 🚀 ∑ ∆ ≠ ≤ ≥ ∞ ∂ ∇ ∫ ∏ ∪ ∩ ⊆ ⊇

Composed vs combining character showdown: café vs cafe01  

Em–dash and — long em-dash having a face-off

NBSP example causing invisible chaos: here A0there

Non-latin text world tour: これは日本語のテキストです。 Пример на русском. 中文示例。

Invisible combining character ninja: ñ (n + \u0303)

## HTML Chaos Mixed with Markdown 🌐

<div style="color: red;">
HTML mixed with    **markdown** creating beautiful disasters
</div>

<details>
<summary>Collapsible content hiding secrets</summary>

Content inside with   weird    spacing issues

- Lists hiding
- Inside HTML
- Like inception

</details>

## Horizontal Rules Having Commitment Issues

## Weird Escaping Adventures 🎭

\*Not emphasized\* and \[Not a link\] pretending to be special

Backslashes having fun: \\ and \` and \# and \-

## Line Breaks and Paragraph Chaos


Multiple


Empty


Lines


Creating


Dramatic


Pauses




Paragraph with  
Two spaces at end for line break magic

Paragraph with\
Backslash line break wizardry

This paragraph has inconsistent  spacing   between  words and multiple   
line breaks in   weird places like a broken typewriter.

## Transclusion and Block Reference Madness

Embedded search query doing mysterious things:

```query
path: "Projects/"
```

Transclusion style adventures: ![[Some Note#^blockref]]

Block IDs scattered around: ^def456 ^unique-block-id ^abc123

## Obsidian-Only Special Features

Embedded content surprises: ![[image.png]] and ![[document.pdf|300]]

Block reference mysteries: [[note#^block-id]] leading to nowhere

Advanced wikilink with block: [[ProjectXYZ#^specific-block]]

## Reference Links and Footnotes (The Finale)

[ref-link]:   https://example.com/ref  "a title with spaces and dreams"
[img-ref]: images/reference.jpg "Reference image title"

[^1]: This is a footnote having an existential crisis.
[^long-note]: Long footnote that has multiple sentences and complex thoughts.  It also contains a code span `inline()` and a wikilink [[Note]] because why not mix everything together.

## Final Chaos Before The End 🎬

Trailing spaces on this line causing invisible mayhem.   

Line with a single TAB	and spaces having a dance party

[[Link at end]] because dramatic exits are important

- Final list item saying goodbye
- With mixed    spacing issues
- And [[wikilinks]] everywhere like confetti

<!-- HTML comment with   weird spacing because even comments deserve chaos -->

The end! 🎉 May your Prettier plugin bring order to this beautiful disaster! ✨
